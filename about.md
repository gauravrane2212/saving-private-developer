Hi, I am <a href="{{ site.author.twitter }}">Gaurav</a>, the maintainer of this blog. Professionally, I work as a mobile app developer in New York. Apart from being a developer, I enjoy cooking, consuming digital content and playing PS4 action-adventure games. I hope to be a better programmer by learning, writing and sharing new weekly blog posts on this site.

Some fun facts about the setup of this project are:

* The name of this project is inspired from one of my favorite war movies ever made, [Saving Private Ryan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120815/)
* Built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme.
* Project maintained using GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE which is awesome :)

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to <a href="{{ site.author.twitter }}">reach me on Twitter</a>.

Thanks for reading!
