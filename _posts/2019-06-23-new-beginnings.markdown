After years of hesitation and procrastination, I am finally determined to start my own blog. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I `haven’t` blogged before. However, after a few weeks of blogging, I wouldn't have the same enthusiasm as when I started and eventually give up.  I would give lame excuses like `Oh, I simply don’t have the time today`, `I don’t know what should I blog about?`, `Have I done enough research about the topic at hand?`, `What if I write something stupid, incorrect and readers start hating me or judging me for what a noob developer I am?`. Once I would go past these doubts and come to terms with myself, I would have already gone ahead with other things in life. This would make me hate the very idea of writing a new blog post and go through this depressing feeling again. :(

### Change of heart?
So recently late last year, after having met with a sudden anxiety issue and later detecting a chronic health problem, I started reading a lot of self-help books/personal development books. One of the books that I stumbled upon was [Atomic Habits][atomic-habits] by [James Clear][james-clear]. It is a gem of a book for people trying to break bad habits and start new good ones. One of the ideas that appealed to me was to make a habit as simple and actionable as possible in order to stick it for a long period of time.

That’s where I started making small minute changes in my life to improve my daily routines and this really inspired me to head back to blogging. With this invigorated enthusiasm, I managed to figure out the two biggest problems with my previous blogging attempts. One was the platform I used to blog in the past (how easy is to blog - from start to finish) and the second is a fixed consistent blogging schedule. Let me go over what I have decided to do in order to be more consistent at blogging.

### Fresh start / New guidelines
To overcome my platform issues, I decided to go back to the basics which meant using a static site generator. Using a static site generator (in this case JEKYLL) gives me the following advantages 1. helping me write my blog content using markdown (which I have been writing a bit at work) 2. makes me focus purely on the blog content that I am publishing 3. using static pages help load the website faster.

For my blogging scheduling concerns, I realized that I never had a niche (specific topics to blog about) nor a fixed schedule. I would previously write about everything I felt like and whenever I felt like. I would definitely like to change that. Simply put, I am going to at least blog once a week (every Wednesday) and teach myself new software development related topics via writing about them.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, I am just going to take baby steps and try to see how long and far I would be able to go on this journey. In hindsight, I feel my current blogging experience has been similar to my initial gymming experience. I always wanted to be a regular at the gym but I always found myself struggling to be consistent. It’s only after I started to align myself into a becoming a person who enjoyed working out, is when I truly became a regular. Blogging for me is the same here. I simply want to make the whole blogging process seamless for me to perform and also try to align myself in becoming a person who writes good stuff regularly. Wish me good luck :)
